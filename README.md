# QVisualize

QGIS 3 plugin

This tool can be used to visualize the features of a point layer one by one. Specifically, you can select a point layer to be visualized, then select the desired time delay (in seconds) and the accumulative or current only display. Then the point features in the layer will appear one by one according. You can use it for example to visualize a moving car/bird/boat etc.
